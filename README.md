## Technology, features and OS support
Polarr for Linux is an Electron app wrapping [Photo Editor for ChromeOS offline](https://www.polarr.co/chrome), therefore the features in the Linux version is nearly identical to our ChromeOS distribution. The .deb installer package was created and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. We did not test on other Linux OSs.

## Purchase pro features
As the Linux package is a wrapper version from our ChromeOS package, you can buy a Chrome OS license from [Photo Editor for ChromeOS offline](https://www.polarr.co/chrome) page, enter your PayPal or CC number, and receive login credentials from your payment email. Your login credential will work for both the Chrome OS and the Linux .deb package.

## RAW support and Face Detection
The difference between the Linux version and ChromeOS version is that the Linux version uses native libraries to provide raw support and face detection. LibRAW is embedded into the package and can decode and process RAW photos better than the web version.
